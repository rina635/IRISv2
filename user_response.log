IRIS: Question 1:  You have to make an important decision in a short time constraint; how do you make it?

When I was a Software Engineer for Microsoft, there were several tight deadlines that we had to make. In order to adequately meet these deadlines, I put in overtime in order to accomplish tasks in a timely manner, which allowed my team to work more effectively on the subsequent tasks. This allowed us to deliver our projects within the deadlines and exceed our clients' expectations.
