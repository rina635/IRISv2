In our conversation, it became apparent that she had not been aware that the lab wasn't getting the tools they needed to sample in a timely manner. I decided to walk through some of the limitations our team has had and work with her to set up an advisory committee. This advisory committee helped enhance the communication between leadership and allowed for more transparency in the company."
