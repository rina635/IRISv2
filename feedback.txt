Answer 4: Being realistic is very important. Dreaming big has its place, but you have to be able to justify that thought with an actionable plan. While I worked at Ross, I would always encourage our store employees to contribute to their retirement plans, because those big dreams are much easier to achieve when you make small consistent steps towards the goal.

Sample answer: "Yes, this did happen to me while I worked at Nokia. I created a roadmap for future the future development of a product we were working on. Unfortunately, a software package brought in did the same, and due to the vendor relationships we decided to go with the software. It was a great learning experience at the end of the day, so I did not mind that it was not ultimately implemented."
