0,"What is one example of a goal you achieved, and how did you work to achieve it?",Goals and Ambition,"While at Instantly, I was promoted 3 times and breached the position of Regional Secretary to the Vice Chancellor. My initial goal was to learn as much as I could in the organization, since I joined straight out of school. But eventually I fell in love with the industry, and the people I met at Instantly were some of the brightest I know."
1,Tell me about a time you went above and beyond your job duties.,Goals and Ambition,"I am a go-getter, and I often have this happen.

I took it as a signal that I needed to shore up some more skills, keep working hard and that my time would come. This was how I was promoted 3 times while working at Acer."
3,Have you struggled to reach a goal and failed? How did you handle it?,Goals and Ambition,"I think it is pretty common for this to happen… after all, we are all human. But the important part is making sure that you can figure out what happened, and work around the issue. While I worked at Michaels, we often had goal building sessions. It was very helpful to see what others were working on and how they dealt with failure and success."
4,How do you set goals in a way that facilitates achieving them?,Goals and Ambition,"Being realistic is very important. Dreaming big has its place, but you have to be able to justify that thought with an actionable plan. While I worked at Ross, I would always encourage our store employees to contribute to their retirement plans, because those big dreams are much easier to achieve when you make small consistent steps towards the goal."
5,What do you do when you finish your work and the day isnâ€™t over yet?,Goals and Ambition,"I look for ways I can help other people on the job. At my time at LG, we used to have a revolving projects noticeboard where you could jump onto a secondary project as an auditor or general assistant. It was very helpful and built a lot of team cohesion."
6,How would you go about seeking out an additional certification for your career?,Goals and Ambition,"I would bring this up with my boss and supervisors as they can truly open many doors in this regard. I think it could partly be because they perhaps do not realize that I need more training to feel comfortable. At my previous job with Universal Music Inc., we had open training days to allow for these sort of recommendations to make their way up."
7,Have you ever had the opportunity to talk to your CEO? What did you talk about?,Goals and Ambition,"I would talk about the ways that we feel supported in the organization.

Complaining never helps anyone."

From my experience as a Door Installer, I would also bring up any issues or pain points we are facing. Its important to be respectful and gauge the conversation though. Complaining never helps anyone."
9,What do you do when you need to make a good impression with a new customer?,Goals and Ambition,"Impression management is definitely a skill I have learned more of while working at Sunset Toyota. The most important part is to make sure customers feel respected. While making the sale, I am not a seller, but rather a friend to my customers."
10,What do you do when you need to make a good impression with management?,Goals and Ambition,Impression management is definitely a skill I have learned more of while working at Sunset Toyota. The most important part is to make sure management feel respected and understand that your communication skills are up to par. This is something that drives me everyday. It is a very important skill to have.
11,What would you do if you were chosen to represent the company at a trade show?,Goals and Ambition,I would love to participate! I was able to travel and present CuteMonkey at SXSW in 2018. It was a great experience and I loved interacting with our customers and clients.
12,What do you do if your job training is going poorly?,Goals and Ambition,"I would communicate this to my supervisors. I think it could partly be because they perhaps do not realize that I need more training to feel comfortable. At my previous job with Universal Music Inc., we had open training days to allow for these sort of recommendations to make their way up."
13,What do you do if you want more training than what your job is providing you?,Goals and Ambition,"I would communicate this to my supervisors. I think it could partly be because they perhaps do not realize that I need more training to feel comfortable. At my previous job with Universal Music Inc., we had open training days to allow for these sort of recommendations to make their way up."
14,Have you ever had to take over for your boss? Is it something you would prefer to do?,Goals and Ambition,"At my previous job as Assistant to the Regional Manager, there were several times during the year that I had to take over. I relished being in charge, and it truly helped me feel alive. I would take up the position again in a heartbeat."
0,"Have you ever noticed a coworker violating company policy? If so, how did you handle it?",Morality and Ethics,"This has not happened to me before.

3,Have you ever had a fellow employee throw you under the bus? How did you handle it?,Morality and Ethics,"Since all of us on the team are working together towards a single goal, I think it is important to create an environment where mistakes are learning opportunities.

4,"What would you do if you found a manager showing clear favoritism for one employee, or the opposite?",Morality and Ethics,"I think communication is an important part of any discussion, and it goes both ways.

It was also an openly communicative team and they were great at expressing themselves, so we never had this issue."
5,Have you ever had the opportunity to duck the blame for something you did? Did you take it?,Morality and Ethics,"I have not had this happen during my time as a Assistant Coordinator. At the end of the day, I have found that avoiding issues within a team does not lead to them being solved. I work to solve the issue, and I have not had any issues diffusing the situation."
6,Do you own up to your mistakes when you make them?,Morality and Ethics,"I do own up to them. It is important to be able to do so, and as a team member working at Ikea, this was something we were constantly told to do. Only when you can be open about these issues can others be open with you."
7,What is the biggest mistake youâ€™ve made as part of your job? How did you correct it?,Morality and Ethics,"As an Intern at Microsoft, I was in charge of a new project that included building a new platform for designers. I made a mistake in initially noting the frameworks that we would need, and had it not been corrected would have been problematic. That is why I constantly check my criteria to make sure nothing falls through."
8,Have you ever been part of an ethically questionable business? How did you handle it?,Morality and Ethics,I have not been a part of a business of that nature. My work as a Designer has allowed me to choose the clients I work with. That is something that would not fly with my values.
9,Have you ever violated company policy to solve a problem or do your job?,Morality and Ethics,"I have not violated policy in any of my jobs at Apple, Microsoft, or Tesla.

10,Have you ever been told to violate safety regulations to do your job? Did you?,Morality and Ethics,"I have had this occur while I interned as a Senior Architect. The time regulations that were set out by the organization before clients could request a review was too long for the scope of our project. We worked around it after I brought the issue up with my managers, and were able to provide a solution that really worked for everyone."
11,Have you ever intentionally violated safety policies to do your job?,Morality and Ethics,"I have not had this happen to me at my time working at Amazon or Microsoft. My work must follow the core values of my organization first. Also, bending rules is against the way that I would work."
12,"Have you ever been asked to perform a task that goes against your personal values, but not company or legal regulations? Did you do it?",Morality and Ethics,"I have not had this happen to me at my time working at Amazon or Microsoft.

2,Have you ever had to deal with an irate manager? What did you do?,Interactions,"While I worked as an intern at a small Law firm in Los Angeles, I cam across a few managers that were more demanding of their employees.

3,Have you ever bent company policy to satisfy a customer?,Interactions,I have had this occur while I interned as a Junior Graphic Designer.

4,Have you ever been unable to bend company policy and irritated a customer?,Interactions,"I have had to do this while I was working as an Lead Developer at Samsung. I had to follow the time regulations set out through the organization before I could onboard additional developers to take care of the user needs.

5,How do you handle bring a problem to the attention of a vendor?,Interactions,"Depending on the type of problem, it is important to make the issue right in a meaningful way.

This would allow the whole team to both be aware and add a voice to how the discussion is brought about."
6,What would you do if you discovered a gross mistake with a customerâ€™s order after theyâ€™ve paid?,Interactions,"I think it would be important to make it right.

7,Have you ever had to defend a customer to your superiors? How did you do it?,Interactions,"I have had to do this while I was working as an Instructor on record at Stanford University.

8,Tell me about the best review youâ€™ve ever gotten from a customer.,Interactions,"While I worked on a team at Amazon, one of our clients gave me a review that said, ""I went above an beyond what was required to get the project right.""

9,Tell me about the worst review youâ€™ve ever gotten from a customer.,Interactions,"While I worked on a team at Amazon, one of our clients gave me a review that said, ""I was too strict with deadlines"".

10,Tell me about a time youâ€™ve had to deal with a client used to exploiting loopholes.,Interactions,"I have not had this happen to me at my time working at Amazon or Microsoft.

3,Which would you lean on to make a decision; logic or a gut feeling?,Miscellaneous ,"I believe both logic and gut have their place, and can go hand in hand. For example, while I was working at Edifier, 1 of my gut choices was pushing to adopt a microtransaction model for our application. This was before they became more common. Logically, as we started looking more into it, it made more sense."
4,Tell me about a time where your gut feelings have been wrong.,Miscellaneous ,"I had a gut feeling turn to be wrong while I worked at Nokia. I created a roadmap for future the future development of a product we were working on. Unfortunately, a software package brought in did the same, and due to the vendor relationships we decided to go with the software. It was a great learning experience at the end of the day, so I did not mind that it was not ultimately implemented."
5,Tell me about the most difficult decision youâ€™ve had to make on the job.,Miscellaneous ,"The most difficult decision I made was scrapping a project we had all spent much time on as a team.

In addressing all the issues, we started making something that tackled too many issues."

If there was one thing, I would say that I wish I had interned earlier at the organization."
7,What would you say is your greatest challenge as a team leader?,Miscellaneous ,"The greatest challenge I face as a team leader is being flexible on deadlines with hard deadlines. For example, while I was working at Edifier, I found we had some team members who were needed by every department and so were spread very thin. My role in the team shifted from leadership to making sure they had room to be able to function correctly."
8,Have you ever had a time where youâ€™ve proposed a solution to a problem only to have it rejected? What did you do?,Miscellaneous ,"Yes, this did happen to me while I worked at Nokia.

9,What would you choose if you had to pick between a professional goal and a personal goal?,Miscellaneous ,"I believe both personal and professional goals have their place, and can go hand in hand.
