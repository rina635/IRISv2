,Question,Category,Sample
0, Tell me about a time where you used logic to solve a problem.,Leadership,"This is my first job application, so I do not have much experience with solving problems at work. However, I solved a lot of mathematical problems with the help of logic, during my lessons in statistical analysis and time row analysis. I must say that I enjoy thinking and using logic to solve a problem, instead of asking someone for help or looking for the most simple solution on Google. ThatÕs not a way to grow intellectually, and to become the best version of yourself, which is a goal I aspire to."
1," Tell me about a decision you made that proved unpopular, and how you handled it.",Leadership,"At my previous job, I was put in charge of a project that involved overseeing a small team of coworkers. It was a rather large project that could greatly influence our clients' view of the company, and it needed to be finished in a short period of time. Unfortunately, we did not have enough time during the week to finish the project, and I realized that we would have to temporarily come in for a few hours on Saturdays in order to complete our tasks. When I delivered the news, many of my coworkers complained and developed resentment for me. Despite their initial misgivings, we finished the project ahead of time and managed to attract several new clients in the process. I knew that my coworkers would be temporarily upset, but I kept the prospect of attracting new clients in mind the entire time."
2, How do you handle your schedule being interrupted?,Leadership,"Having worked in consulting for almost 2 years and half of it being remote, I definitely have had to become more flexible in my schedule. On a typical day, I do have a list of things I need to accomplish and do allow for an extra 15 minutes here and there to account for periods where I may be interrupted. I also try to keep open commuication of what I'm up to with my direct supervisors and coworkers so people are aware of what is going on with my schedule. I think by being proactice and maintaining constant communication, it becomes easier."
3, Have you ever had to convince a team to work on a project they didnâ€™t like? How did you do it?,Leadership,TBA
4, Have you had to solve a squabble between two team members? How did you do it?,Leadership,"Yes, during one of my group projects at VCU I had two team members argue about which topic to choose. They both felt very passionate about their topics and it was becoming increasingly disruptive. I resolved the conflict by having them both pitch their ideas to the rest of the group and after that, have the group take an anonymous survey to decide what one to proceed with."
5," Have you ever gone to bat for your team in opposition to a higher-up in your company? How did you do it, and how did it work out?",Leadership,"Yes, during my time at Bode Technology my supervisor had begun frustrated with the pace new trainees had been sampling. In our conversation, it became apparent that she had not been aware that the lab wasn't getting the tools they needed to sample in a timely manner. I decided to walk through some of the limitations our team has had and work with her to set up an advisory committee. This advisory committee helped enhance the communication between leadership and allowed for more transparency in the company."
6, How would you go about motivating a team member who is struggling?,Leadership,"The way I have gone about this in the past is by listening to my team members concerns. As a student orientation leader at my university, I encoountered some coworkers that had felt drained by their students and felt unable to stay positive during the long hours. It was really easy for my team members to feel jealous of more experienced workers and created a jealous environment. I admitted I also felt the same way sometimes and gave them tips on how to stay engaged. I think by letting them knnow I have also experienced that made them feel more assured that what they were going through was normal, which helped them to get out of that very negative headspace that was hindering them. Everyone struggles, but helping people realize they are not alone in that helps build confidence."
7, Have you ever had to make a risky decision? How did it turn out?,Leadership,"Absolutely, a risky decision for me was deciding to quit my job and pursue my master's degree at GMU in a new field. I came to realize that I was limiting myself and not allowing myself to be challenged. Although I really enjoyed working at Bode Technology and I did not having a backup job to support myself, it was economically risky and a very stressful decision to make. At the end of the day, I knew that I loved learning and research, this is a new field but I trusted my ability to make a decision for myself. It worked out better than I expected, I was still able to create a positive impact impact and make my own unique path."
8, How would you handle a team member who failed to reach their goals?,Leadership,"I personally, have only been on the receiving end of this but when my goals and performances were discussed I would want someone to first ask me what my goals are and my opinion. At Bode Technology, I appreciated when superiors would listen to what my goals were and we could colloborate on how to get me there. Priotizing that team member's goals and how it translates to the work being done or the client's mission is important to highlight. At the end of the day, what matters is how we can get a team members ability to align with the work. I have always appreciated an honest critique if my personal goals have perhaps pivoted."
9, How do you prioritize your projects?,Leadership,"I begin by collecting a list of all the tasks needed to be done and denote each one based on level of urgency, approximate time, and value it pertains to the company. Priotizing project also comes down to just being flexible and open about your personal bandwith. At Lynch Consultants LLC, I was often on multiple engagements at once and what really helped my team was me constantly communicating where I was at and being realistic on what was do-able. It made a huge difference in my ability to prioritize projects."
10, Tell me about a time you solved a problem in a creative or unorthodox way.,Leadership,"When I was a forensic scientist at Bode Technology, we often found discrepancies between what supplies were being ordered compared to what was actually needed. Two employees were in charge of ordering for the two lab rooms, however, since they were promoted they were no longer in the rooms using the supplies. Since some techniques had changes since they were in these roles, we needed a different number of plates et certera. I proposed a new system of ordering things where each room designates an person to order for their lab who does actively work in the room and we keep a spreadsheet up-to-date of what each person needs because we had some employees who worked in the evenings who did not get to voice their opinions either. This helped alleviate the workload of the former technologists and ensured the ordering process had more accuracy. This also allowed us to work more efficiently since we no longer had to stop to grab supplies in between work flows."

But eventually I fell in love with the industry, and the people I met at Instantly were some of the brightest I know."

2, Have you been passed over for a promotion? How did you react?,Goals and Ambition,"It has happened to me, but I understand it is a difficult position to be in for a manager.

3, Have you struggled to reach a goal and failed? How did you handle it?,Goals and Ambition,"I think it is pretty common for this to happen… after all, we are all human. But the important part is making sure that you can figure out what happened, and work around the issue. While I worked at Michaels, we often had goal building sessions. It was very helpful to see what others were working on and how they dealt with failure and success."
4, How do you set goals in a way that facilitates achieving them?,Goals and Ambition,"Being realistic is very important. Dreaming big has its place, but you have to be able to justify that thought with an actionable plan. While I worked at Ross, I would always encourage our store employees to contribute to their retirement plans, because those big dreams are much easier to achieve when you make small consistent steps towards the goal."
5, What do you do when you finish your work and the day isnâ€™t over yet?,Goals and Ambition,"I look for ways I can help other people on the job. At my time at LG, we used to have a revolving projects noticeboard where you could jump onto a secondary project as an auditor or general assistant. It was very helpful and built a lot of team cohesion."
6, How would you go about seeking out an additional certification for your career?,Goals and Ambition,"I would bring this up with my boss and supervisors as they can truly open many doors in this regard. I think it could partly be because they perhaps do not realize that I need more training to feel comfortable. At my previous job with Universal Music Inc., we had open training days to allow for these sort of recommendations to make their way up."
7, Have you ever had the opportunity to talk to your CEO? What did you talk about?,Goals and Ambition,"I would talk about the ways that we feel supported in the organization.

Complaining never helps anyone."

Complaining never helps anyone."
9, What do you do when you need to make a good impression with a new customer?,Goals and Ambition,"Impression management is definitely a skill I have learned more of while working at Sunset Toyota.

3, Have you ever had a fellow employee throw you under the bus? How did you handle it?,Morality and Ethics,"Since all of us on the team are working together towards a single goal, I think it is important to create an environment where mistakes are learning opportunities.

4," What would you do if you found a manager showing clear favoritism for one employee, or the opposite?",Morality and Ethics,"I think communication is an important part of any discussion, and it goes both ways. When I worked for Nestle, my manager would bring us all together and lay their thinking out before everyone, and show how they were thinking of making decisions. It was also an openly communicative team and they were great at expressing themselves, so we never had this issue."
5, Have you ever had the opportunity to duck the blame for something you did? Did you take it?,Morality and Ethics,"I have not had this happen during my time as a Assistant Coordinator. At the end of the day, I have found that avoiding issues within a team does not lead to them being solved. I work to solve the issue, and I have not had any issues diffusing the situation."
6, Do you own up to your mistakes when you make them?,Morality and Ethics,"I do own up to them. It is important to be able to do so, and as a team member working at Ikea, this was something we were constantly told to do. Only when you can be open about these issues can others be open with you."
7, What is the biggest mistake youâ€™ve made as part of your job? How did you correct it?,Morality and Ethics,"As an Intern at Microsoft, I was in charge of a new project that included building a new platform for designers.

That is why I constantly check my criteria to make sure nothing falls through."
8, Have you ever been part of an ethically questionable business? How did you handle it?,Morality and Ethics,I have not been a part of a business of that nature. My work as a Designer has allowed me to choose the clients I work with. That is something that would not fly with my values.
9, Have you ever violated company policy to solve a problem or do your job?,Morality and Ethics,"I have not violated policy in any of my jobs at Apple, Microsoft, or Tesla.

We worked around it after I brought the issue up with my managers, and were able to provide a solution that really worked for everyone."
11, Have you ever intentionally violated safety policies to do your job?,Morality and Ethics,"I have not had this happen to me at my time working at Amazon or Microsoft. My work must follow the core values of my organization first. Also, bending rules is against the way that I would work."

Did you do it?",Morality and Ethics,"I have not had this happen to me at my time working at Amazon or Microsoft.

2, Have you ever had to deal with an irate manager? What did you do?,Interactions,"While I worked as an intern at a small Law firm in Los Angeles, I cam across a few managers that were more demanding of their employees.

3, Have you ever bent company policy to satisfy a customer?,Interactions,I have had this occur while I interned as a Junior Graphic Designer.

4, Have you ever been unable to bend company policy and irritated a customer?,Interactions,"I have had to do this while I was working as an Lead Developer at Samsung. I had to follow the time regulations set out through the organization before I could onboard additional developers to take care of the user needs.

5, How do you handle bring a problem to the attention of a vendor?,Interactions,"Depending on the type of problem, it is important to make the issue right in a meaningful way.

This would allow the whole team to both be aware and add a voice to how the discussion is brought about."
6, What would you do if you discovered a gross mistake with a customerâ€™s order after theyâ€™ve paid?,Interactions,"I think it would be important to make it right.

I had this happen briefly as a Project Manager at KPMG, and the client was extremely impressed we brought it to their attention."
7, Have you ever had to defend a customer to your superiors? How did you do it?,Interactions,"I have had to do this while I was working as an Instructor on record at Stanford University. I had to defend the wants of students, regarding a specific change to the curriculum they wanted to see. I think it was important to function as a mediator between the customers and organization."
8, Tell me about the best review youâ€™ve ever gotten from a customer.,Interactions,"While I worked on a team at Amazon, one of our clients gave me a review that said, ""I went above an beyond what was required to get the project right.""

9, Tell me about the worst review youâ€™ve ever gotten from a customer.,Interactions,"While I worked on a team at Amazon, one of our clients gave me a review that said, ""I was too strict with deadlines"".

10, Tell me about a time youâ€™ve had to deal with a client used to exploiting loopholes.,Interactions,"I have not had this happen to me at my time working at Amazon or Microsoft.

3, Which would you lean on to make a decision; logic or a gut feeling?,Miscellaneous ,"I believe both logic and gut have their place, and can go hand in hand. For example, while I was working at Edifier, 1 of my gut choices was pushing to adopt a microtransaction model for our application. This was before they became more common. Logically, as we started looking more into it, it made more sense."
4, Tell me about a time where your gut feelings have been wrong.,Miscellaneous ,"I had a gut feeling turn to be wrong while I worked at Nokia. I created a roadmap for future the future development of a product we were working on. Unfortunately, a software package brought in did the same, and due to the vendor relationships we decided to go with the software. It was a great learning experience at the end of the day, so I did not mind that it was not ultimately implemented."
5, Tell me about the most difficult decision youâ€™ve had to make on the job.,Miscellaneous ,"The most difficult decision I made was scrapping a project we had all spent much time on as a team.

In addressing all the issues, we started making something that tackled too many issues."
6, What do you regret most about your previous job?,Miscellaneous ,"Honestly, I do not have any regrets from my previous job.

If there was one thing, I would say that I wish I had interned earlier at the organization."
7, What would you say is your greatest challenge as a team leader?,Miscellaneous ,"The greatest challenge I face as a team leader is being flexible on deadlines with hard deadlines. For example, while I was working at Edifier, I found we had some team members who were needed by every department and so were spread very thin. My role in the team shifted from leadership to making sure they had room to be able to function correctly."
8, Have you ever had a time where youâ€™ve proposed a solution to a problem only to have it rejected? What did you do?,Miscellaneous ,"Yes, this did happen to me while I worked at Nokia. I created a roadmap for future the future development of a product we were working on.

It was a great learning experience at the end of the day, so I did not mind that it was not ultimately implemented."
9, What would you choose if you had to pick between a professional goal and a personal goal?,Miscellaneous ,"I believe both personal and professional goals have their place, and can go hand in hand. For example, while I was working at Edifier, 1 of my professional goals were to create an actionable video for my department. To improve my video editing skills, I started creating YouTube videos in my free time."
