 Tell me about a time where you used logic to solve a problem.,Leadership,"This is my first job application, so I do not have much experience with solving problems at work. However, I solved a lot of mathematical problems with the help of logic, during my lessons in statistical analysis and time row analysis. I must say that I enjoy thinking and using logic to solve a problem, instead of asking someone for help or looking for the most simple solution on Google. ThatÕs not a way to grow intellectually, and to become the best version of yourself, which is a goal I aspire to."
" Tell me about a decision you made that proved unpopular, and how you handled it.",Leadership,"At my previous job, I was put in charge of a project that involved overseeing a small team of coworkers. It was a rather large project that could greatly influence our clients' view of the company, and it needed to be finished in a short period of time. Unfortunately, we did not have enough time during the week to finish the project, and I realized that we would have to temporarily come in for a few hours on Saturdays in order to complete our tasks. When I delivered the news, many of my coworkers complained and developed resentment for me. Despite their initial misgivings, we finished the project ahead of time and managed to attract several new clients in the process. I knew that my coworkers would be temporarily upset, but I kept the prospect of attracting new clients in mind the entire time."
 How do you handle your schedule being interrupted?,Leadership,"Having worked in consulting for almost 2 years and half of it being remote, I definitely have had to become more flexible in my schedule. On a typical day, I do have a list of things I need to accomplish and do allow for an extra 15 minutes here and there to account for periods where I may be interrupted. I also try to keep open commuication of what I'm up to with my direct supervisors and coworkers so people are aware of what is going on with my schedule. I think by being proactice and maintaining constant communication, it becomes easier."
 Have you ever had to convince a team to work on a project they didnâ€™t like? How did you do it?,Leadership,"Yes, I had. When I was working in Amazon as penetration testing team leader. We conducted social engineering penetration testing to test the employeesÕ awareness by sending phishing emails that notified us if the employee open the malicious file.

This advisory committee helped enhance the communication between leadership and allowed for more transparency in the company."
 How would you go about motivating a team member who is struggling?,Leadership,"The way I have gone about this in the past is by listening to my team members concerns. As a student orientation leader at my university, I encoountered some coworkers that had felt drained by their students and felt unable to stay positive during the long hours. It was really easy for my team members to feel jealous of more experienced workers and created a jealous environment. I admitted I also felt the same way sometimes and gave them tips on how to stay engaged. I think by letting them knnow I have also experienced that made them feel more assured that what they were going through was normal, which helped them to get out of that very negative headspace that was hindering them. Everyone struggles, but helping people realize they are not alone in that helps build confidence."
 Have you ever had to make a risky decision? How did it turn out?,Leadership,"Absolutely, a risky decision for me was deciding to quit my job and pursue my master's degree at GMU in a new field. I came to realize that I was limiting myself and not allowing myself to be challenged. Although I really enjoyed working at Bode Technology and I did not having a backup job to support myself, it was economically risky and a very stressful decision to make.

It worked out better than I expected, I was still able to create a positive impact impact and make my own unique path."
 How would you handle a team member who failed to reach their goals?,Leadership,"I personally, have only been on the receiving end of this but when my goals and performances were discussed I would want someone to first ask me what my goals are and my opinion. At Bode Technology, I appreciated when superiors would listen to what my goals were and we could colloborate on how to get me there. Priotizing that team member's goals and how it translates to the work being done or the client's mission is important to highlight. At the end of the day, what matters is how we can get a team members ability to align with the work. I have always appreciated an honest critique if my personal goals have perhaps pivoted."
 How do you prioritize your projects?,Leadership,"I begin by collecting a list of all the tasks needed to be done and denote each one based on level of urgency, approximate time, and value it pertains to the company. Priotizing project also comes down to just being flexible and open about your personal bandwith.

It made a huge difference in my ability to prioritize projects."
 Tell me about a time you solved a problem in a creative or unorthodox way.,Leadership,"When I was a forensic scientist at Bode Technology, we often found discrepancies between what supplies were being ordered compared to what was actually needed. Two employees were in charge of ordering for the two lab rooms, however, since they were promoted they were no longer in the rooms using the supplies. Since some techniques had changes since they were in these roles, we needed a different number of plates et certera. I proposed a new system of ordering things where each room designates an person to order for their lab who does actively work in the room and we keep a spreadsheet up-to-date of what each person needs because we had some employees who worked in the evenings who did not get to voice their opinions either. This helped alleviate the workload of the former technologists and ensured the ordering process had more accuracy. This also allowed us to work more efficiently since we no longer had to stop to grab supplies in between work flows."
 How do you prioritize service to a large number of clients at the same time?,Leadership,"This can be done by determining those clients  who are with special needs like handicapped and elderly.

 What do you regret most about your previous job?,Miscellaneous ,"Honestly, I do not have any regrets from my previous job. The work was important and we made a real difference by providing healthcare services to the greater DMV area. If there was one thing, I would say that I wish I had interned earlier at the organization."
 What would you say is your greatest challenge as a team leader?,Miscellaneous ,"The greatest challenge I face as a team leader is being flexible on deadlines with hard deadlines. For example, while I was working at Edifier, I found we had some team members who were needed by every department and so were spread very thin. My role in the team shifted from leadership to making sure they had room to be able to function correctly."
 Have you ever had a time where youâ€™ve proposed a solution to a problem only to have it rejected? What did you do?,Miscellaneous ,"Yes, this did happen to me while I worked at Nokia. I created a roadmap for future the future development of a product we were working on. Unfortunately, a software package brought in did the same, and due to the vendor relationships we decided to go with the software. It was a great learning experience at the end of the day, so I did not mind that it was not ultimately implemented."
 What would you choose if you had to pick between a professional goal and a personal goal?,Miscellaneous ,"I believe both personal and professional goals have their place, and can go hand in hand. For example, while I was working at Edifier, 1 of my professional goals were to create an actionable video for my department. To improve my video editing skills, I started creating YouTube videos in my free time."
